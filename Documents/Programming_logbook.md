# Programming logbook

The goal of today will be to create a good mesh for our problem. 
I found an interesting forum [discussion](https://www.cfd-online.com/Forums/openfoam-meshing/88973-simple-sphere-snappyhexmesh.html) about meshing spheres in openFoam.
Post #7 seems promising to me, he shares 2 different snappyHexMesh files (a meshing utility in openFoam to alter simple blockmeshes) and a blockmesh file.
I will first just coppy these files in the case, run them by first using the blockMesh command and then the snappyHexMesh command.
Then I will look at the meshes created in paraView and adjust from there.

This is the mesh generated by the snappyHexMeshDictSphere file in the previously described forum post. 
It looks like a good starting point but lets double check the mesh generated by the other snappyHexMeshDict file in the forum post.

This is the mesh generated by the snappyHexMeshDictcavity file. This is further away from our goal mesh so I'll use the snappyHexMeshDictSphere file as starting point.
